# Accessibility (A11Y)

This document describes the accessibility improvements implemented in my AirBrB application.  
All listed items accurately reflect what has been implemented in the submitted UI.

---

## 1. Semantic Headings and Page Structure

- Major screens use clear headings (e.g., `<h1>Create Listing>`, `<h1>Manage bookings>`).
- Typography components are rendered using semantic HTML heading levels, which helps screen-reader users understand page hierarchy.

---

## 2. Form Field Accessibility

- All input fields (login, register, search filters, create listing, booking form) have either visible labels or descriptive placeholders.
- Inputs from MUI provide built-in accessibility attributes such as ARIA labels and helper text support.
- Clear validation messages are shown for incorrect inputs (e.g., password mismatch, invalid date range).

---

## 3. Keyboard Accessibility

- All interactive UI components are standard MUI elements (Buttons, IconButtons, TextFields, Select, Tabs, DatePickers).
- These components fully support keyboard navigation out-of-the-box:
  - Tab navigation
  - Enter/Space activation
  - Arrow-key navigation inside dropdowns / tab lists

---

## 4. Visible Focus Indicators

- The application inherits MUI’s default focus outline styles.
- Focus indicators remain visible for buttons, fields, dropdowns, tabs and search controls.
- No custom CSS overwrites focus outlines, ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.4.7.

---

## 5. Alternative Text for Images

- All listing thumbnails and property images include `alt` text describing the image or its purpose.
- Decorative icons (e.g. star outline icons) use `aria-hidden` via MUI defaults.

---

## 6. Colour Contrast and Non-Colour Cues

- The interface uses high-contrast text (black on white) which meets WCAG AA contrast levels.
- Status indicators such as **Live / Pending** include text labels, ensuring information is not conveyed by colour alone.
- Error messages and disabled button states include both colour and text.

---

## 7. Clear and Descriptive Button Labels

- Buttons use meaningful text such as “CREATE LISTING”, “MAKE A BOOKING”, “EDIT”, “UNPUBLISH”.
- The search button includes an accessible icon button label via MUI.

---

## 8. Responsive and Scalable Layout

- Layout uses MUI Grid and responsive container widths.
- The interface remains usable at zoom levels up to 200% without structure breaking.
- Text uses scalable units through MUI’s typography system.

---

## 9. Accessible Forms & Error Feedback

- Form errors appear next to the relevant field (e.g., register password mismatch, backend errors on login).
- Error messages are text-based, not colour-only.
- Booking form prevents invalid date ranges and provides descriptive feedback.

---

## Summary

The application includes semantic heading structure, labelled form fields, accessible MUI components, keyboard navigation, visible focus, contrast-safe colours, meaningful alt text, and responsive design.  
These improvements enhance usability for screen-reader users, keyboard-only users, and users with low vision.
